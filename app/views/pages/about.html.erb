<p class= "AboutText">My name is Gerard Dawson, and I want to help you communicate with your students.
	<br>The Learning Loop is an application that does a few great things for teachers and students:
	<ul class="List">
		<li>Post feedback after a specific lesson or assignment
		<li>Link to "flipped" videos or other materials related to your feedback
		<li>Allow students to acknowledge, respond to, or ask questions about your feedback
		<li>Give students a place to relfect on their work and the feedback you've provided
	</ul>
